FastMultiplication
=======================

Uses naive, Karatsuba, and hopefully at some point Toom-Cook 3-Way for fast multiplication of 2
integers. Works for any number from base 2 to base 4,294,967,295. Designed for Mac.


Instructions
=======================

  1. Go into interface.c

  2. Change numbers to what you want them to be

  3. Specify the base (works for anything from base 2 to base 4,294,967,295)

  4. Run "make all"

  5. Call "./result"
